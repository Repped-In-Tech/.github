# Get Repped In Tech (GRIT)

It should not be difficult for historically excluded tech creators to build successful careers on top of having to deal with outdated expectations of who a tech creator is, what they look like, and what they should know.

Vision: To provide community for diverse techies where they can grow into the best professional technologist versions of themselves

Mission: To significantly increase retention of traditionally excluded technical creators through providing social and emotional support. Our community and educational programs are geared towards empowering underrepresented techies, fortifying allies, and engaging sponsors while also advocating for equitable tech spaces and real opportunities for growth.
