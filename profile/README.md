# Get Repped In Tech (GRIT)

On top of building a successful career, historically excluded tech creators have to battle outdated expectations of who a tech creator is, what they ‘should’ look like, and what they ‘should’ know. 

We’re committed to changing this — ~because it shouldn’t be this difficult.~

**Our vision is simple yet powerful:**

To provide a community for diverse techies where they can grow into the best, professional, technologist versions of themselves.

**Our mission is to change the game by making our own rules:**

To significantly increase retention of traditionally excluded technical creators by providing social and emotional support. Our community and educational programs are geared towards empowering underrepresented techies, fortifying allies, and engaging sponsors while also advocating for equitable tech spaces and real opportunities for growth.
